Dancing in the moonlight. Everybody dancing in the moonlight. Zodiac Monkey, I want to part like its 1969. Oh yeah this is the most beuatiful time of the year. Boom it is the year 1992 and it is the day gentleman. It is the end of your misery. You will now be in a shrine, and no longer be on earth. Pack you bags because we are going to Mars and it is the end of the world. Snake monkey rat gerbil.
